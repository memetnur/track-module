Task 2

Query 1
Select the column "name" from the table "protein" (hereafter, referred to as "protein.name")
SELECT "protein"."name" FROM "protein"

Query 2
Select the columns name and sequence from the table protein, sort the result in descending order of the names (use "Sort" in the design view)
SELECT "name" FROM "protein" ORDER BY "name" ASC

Query 3
In the species table, show the name and scientific_name of the rat
Hint: use "Criterion" in the design view
SELECT "name", "scientific_name" FROM "species" WHERE "name" = 'rat'

Query 4
Do the same as in Query 3, but only display the scientific_name
SELECT "scientific_name" FROM "species" WHERE "name" = 'rat'

Query 5
In the species table, show the name and scientific_name of rat and human
Hint: use "Criterion" and "Or" in the design view
SELECT "name", "scientific_name" FROM "species" WHERE ( "name" = 'rat' OR "name" = 'human' )

Query 6
Select the protein names and sequences for proteins that contain the subsequence SHS.
Hint: write the following in the appropriate "Criterion"-field: LIKE 'SHS*'
SELECT "name", "sequence" FROM "protein" WHERE "sequence" LIKE '%SHS%'

Query 7
Select the protein names and sequences for proteins that contain the subsequence "SHS" or the subsequence "GY"
SELECT "name", "sequence" FROM "protein" WHERE ( "sequence" LIKE '%SHS%' OR "sequence" LIKE '%GY%' )

Query 8
Show all the human proteins
Hint: In the design view form, you need on column for the species table (to insert "human" in "Criterion"), and one column for the protein table (to select the protein name)
SELECT "species"."name", "protein"."name" FROM "protein", "species" WHERE "protein"."species_id" = "species"."ID" AND "species"."name" = 'human'

Query 9
Count the number of human proteins
Hint: 1. Build on Query 8; 2. make sure to disable visibility of the species name; 3. Use the function "Count"
SELECT COUNT( "protein"."name" ) FROM "protein", "species" WHERE "protein"."species_id" = "species"."ID" AND "species"."name" = 'human'


Task 3

SQL-Query 1
Modify Query 1 to show species.scientific_name
Solution: SELECT "scientific_name" FROM "species"

SQL-Query 2
Modify Query 2 to sort in descending order (substituting DESC by ASC)
Solution: SELECT "name", "sequence" FROM "protein" ORDER BY "name" ASC

SQL-Query 3
Modify Query 3 to show the scientific name (only) of human
Solution: SELECT "scientific_name" FROM "species" WHERE "name" = 'human'

SQL-Query 4
Modify Query 5 to show the sequence of "GTM1_HUMAN" and "GTM2_HUMAN"
Solution: SELECT "sequence" FROM "protein" WHERE ( "name" = 'GTM1_HUMAN' OR "name" = 'GTM2_HUMAN' )

SQL-Query 5
Modify Query 6 to show results of proteins that contain the subsequence KM
Solution: SELECT "name", "sequence" FROM "protein" WHERE "sequence" LIKE '%KM%'
